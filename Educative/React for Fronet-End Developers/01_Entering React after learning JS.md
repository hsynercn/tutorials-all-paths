# Entering React after learning JavaScript

React is a view only library, Model View Controller (MVC) is a design pattern that is used to separate the data from representation.

REact has a simple API and JS provides both functional and object-oriented programming paradigms.

Learning JS before React is beneficial, otherwise JS specific problems could be difficult to solve.
