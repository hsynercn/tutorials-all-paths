# Procedural Generation In Game Design

## Chapter 24 Automated Game Tuning

We need to fine tune parameters to create a good game. But it's hard to do it manually. So we need to automate it.

### Step1: Set Parameters

Flappy Bird is a good example. We can set the following parameters:

- Bird speed
- Pipe gap
- Pipe gap location range
- Pipe width
- Pipe separation

### Step2: Set Generate The Game Level

We can generate the game level with the parameters. We can use a random approach.

### Step3: Simulate The Game

We have AI to play the game. We will intentionally make the AI play badly like a human.

### Step4: Analyze The Data

We can analyze the data to see how the game is played. We can use the final score as the metric.

### Step5: Visualize The Data and Make Adjustments

We can visualize the data to see how the game is played. We can adjust the parameters to make the game better for overall play.

These steps don't require advanced statistics.
