# Procedural Generation In Game Design

## Chapter 25 Generating Rules

We are using procedural generation for different reasons. Some cases are rare, like storylines. Probably rarest case is the game rules.

Rules could define everything about a game, or just form a sort of suggestive space in which the player can freely express themselves.

We don't see rules or mechanics generated by a game very often, and it's partly because how fundamental they are.

To create a different experience we can modify the parameters of the game. Usually extract and gather the parameters and then fine-tune them. We can easily change them to create a different experience. Or we can consider rule generation. If we choose simpler rules we can easily build a language.

### Throwing Out The Rulebook

The little system we designed, with series of building blocks for rules, guidelines to filter out bad ides, and a random player to test the game for us, is a really basic recipe for experimenting with rules.
