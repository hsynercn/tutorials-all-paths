# Procedural Generation In Game Design

## Chapter 27 Meaning

Can a procedural generation give close depth to a handcrafted experience? Can it be used to create a meaningful experience?

### Meaning in Games

Meaning in games created through forging connections between elements of that experience. Mostly meaning exists outside the formal mechanics of the game.

There are some cases when lore overpowers the game itself. Elders Scrolls Oblivion is a good example, books in the game are more interesting than the game itself.

A meaningful game world must be somehow hermetically sealed, giving out just the right amount of information.

### Meaningleesness In Games

In some cases we will create a large amount of content which does not create much interest on the player side. 

It is hard to avoid in procedural generation, but can be adapted to one's advantage if presented as a contracts that highlights the meaningful elements.

### Designer and Player Meaning

Many games utilizing procedural generation have a large database of fixed content that is placed first, and then procedural content is set up around.

### Conclusion

An opposition between meaning and randomness need not always be present. Easily we can add unchanging meaning to a procedural world.
