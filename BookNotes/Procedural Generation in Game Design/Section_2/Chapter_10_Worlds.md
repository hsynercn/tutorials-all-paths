# Procedural Generation In Game Design

## Chapter 10 Worlds

In procedurally generating a world, world elements at both the macro and microscale require modeling. 

This chapter will examine 3 elements of procedural world generation:

- A brief history of world generation.
- Details of desıgn ratıonales behınd the development of world generatıon.
- Future of it and fairly unusual work in this area.

### Brief History of World Generation

Several examples:

- Akalabeth (1980)
- Elite (1984)
- Civilization (1991)
- River Raid (1982)
- Alpha Centauri (1999)
- Dwarf Fortress (2006)
- Minecraft (2009)
- No Man's Sky (2016)

Some creations prefer node-based system rather than square or hexagonal grids.

If we look at these examples we can perceive two different models of procedural generation.

- 1st model (Civilization): World as a space for player to act upon.
- 2nd model (Dwarf Fortress): World as a system for player to act within.

Gmaes that employ the first model we generate world as a "pace" therefore holds a "sandbox" concept. They are concerned with making an interesting space for player to explore and play with it.

Second model creates complex systems for player to act within. Town, villages, peoples, and stillbeing-written mythologies...

### Why Make Worlds?

There are 3 main reasons to generate rather than handmake a world:

- Exploration ad a game mechanic.
- As a method for creating worlds that are simply too large or too complex.
- Enforce gameplay variation.

### Exploration

In a fixed world we can provide exploration at the first run. Some games deal with this by difficulty, like Souls series. In procedural worlds exploration can be consistent.

Procedural world generation therefore ensures that exploration remains a game mechanic that can deliver gameplay experiences on every playthrough, rather than just the first.

### Expansive or Complex Worlds

Handmade results cannot compete with procedural results. Even for same cases PCG creates entire galaxies like No Man's Sky.

### Gameplay Variation

Procedural worlds push increased gameplay varıatıon on the player. Each generation could bring new challanges to player, it will force player to follow different styles, new ways to achieve their goals.

### Qualitative Procedural Generation

When we talk about generation we can include different aspects: societies, cultures, politics, religions, institutions, social norms, aesthetics, terrain, environment.

Systemic procedural worlds hinge in part upon the interactions between parge numbers of complex systems that have to be uncovered by the player.

Qualitative procedural generation is a major future step in the generation of procedural worlds, both for the sake of the complexity and for the sake of innovative gameplay.
