# Procedural Generation In Game Design

## Chapter 10 Worlds

In procedurally generating a world, world elements at both the macro and microscale require modeling. 

This chapter will examine 3 elements of procedural world generation:

- A brief history of world generation.
- Details of des覺gn rat覺onales beh覺nd the development of world generat覺on.
- Future of it and fairly unusual work in this area.

### Brief History of World Generation

Several examples:

- Akalabeth (1980)
- Elite (1984)
- Civilization (1991)
- River Raid (1982)
- Alpha Centauri (1999)
- Dwarf Fortress (2006)
- Minecraft (2009)
- No Man's Sky (2016)

Some creations prefer node-based system rather than square or hexagonal grids.

If we look at these examples we can perceive two different models of procedural generation.

- 1st model (Civilization): World as a space for player to act upon.
- 2nd model (Dwarf Fortress): World as a system for player to act within.

Gmaes that employ the first model we generate world as a "pace" therefore holds a "sandbox" concept. They are concerned with making an interesting space for player to explore and play with it.

Second model creates complex systems for player to act within. Town, villages, peoples, and stillbeing-written mythologies...

### Why Make Worlds?

There are 3 main reasons to generate rather than handmake a world:

- Exploration ad a game mechanic.
- As a method for creating worlds that are simply too large or too complex.
- Enforce gameplay variation.

### Exploration

In a fixed world we can provide exploration at the first run.
