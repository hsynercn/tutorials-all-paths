# Procedural Generation In Game Design

## Chapter 17 Audio and Composition

Skipping Stones is an experimental game in which player throws found rocks from a beach over the water, creating generated music.

### Procedural Process

- Sampling: Game uses a sample-based synthesis approach.
- Pitch: Western music contains only 12 notes, which are then repeated over about 11 octaves.

### Procedural Composition

- Beat: We need a metronome to play sounds in a order.
- Scale: We are allowed to play some notes in specific conditions.
- Steps: We need to pay attention to whole steps and half steps.
- Chords: Simply notes that sound good when played together.

### Conclusion

It is better to understand music theory to build an engine.
