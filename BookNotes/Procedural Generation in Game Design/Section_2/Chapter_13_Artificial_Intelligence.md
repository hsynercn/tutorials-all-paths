# Procedural Generation In Game Design

## Chapter 13 Artificial Intelligence

Not all procedural generation content need AI. Some games are focused on feeling of exploration of an unpredictable space.

If we bring AI in procedural content, AI should be able to cope with near-infinite varieties of space.

### Unpredictability and AI

AI often contains elements of unpredictability:

1. Challange: Unpredictable AI can boost the range of gameplay possibilities over a more deterministic equivalent.
2. Exploit Resistant: Predictable opponents can often be exploited.
3. Balance: A fun opponent includes elements of game design, psychology, socÄ±ology and even interface design. It is not only computer science and game theory.

### Movement and Combat

AI is heavily focused on tow elements movement and combat.

### Ambient Behavior

AI that carries out certain actions even when the player is not nearby or engaged with the AI actor.

### Emergent Phenomena

Situations where sets of simple behaviors lead to often unanticipated sets of more complex behaviors.

### Conversations

We can use PCG to create a dialog system.

### Conclusion

PCG developers must consider the values they want their world to express, and move from this into developing their characters' strategies, speech, and desires.
