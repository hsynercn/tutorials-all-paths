## Chapter 15 Generative Artwork

Today's digital art has a fixation on fidelity and technical showiness.

1. Today's technical excellence is dependent on funding, available time, education, and other resources.
2. Cultural emphasis is discouraging people.
3. This is not an interesting or useful metric for evaluating art.

### Techniques

- Scope is not quality; it is a separate axis: Before addind details, try taking a step back. What does your piece feel like, and how does that differ from how you want it to feel?
- Thinking in terms of processes: Are your algorithms emotinally relevant to your project?
- Symmetry and structure: We have a power within digital methods, iterative processes naturally tap into human perception. Humans have a strong natural response to symmetry.
- Mark making: Consider the ways you are making marks. Writing your own low-level drawing routines can open up a wide range of mark-making possibilties.
- Postprocessing: Altering your output after creation.

### Perception of Intent

Searching forthe intent of the creator is a natural human way to interact with any artifact.
