# Procedural Generation In Game Design

## Chapter 16 Generative Art Toys

Everyone likes being creative.

Art toys are more free, they are not bounded to game context. If we focus on the content more player can directly interact with the generator itself. When users feel creative' both the users and apps win.

Become a Great Artist in Just 10 Seconds by Michael Brough and Andi McClure is a good example of art toy.

### Trading Control for Power

The central idea behind an art toy is that user is trading away control and gaining power. Art tools and art toys are different in this sense.

The automation has taken away a bit of freedom, but has given us a faster more reliable way to get to satisfying results.

### Kasparov's Centaur

Garry Kasparov lost a game to IBM Deep Blue, in 1988 he played first game of "advanced chess" against Vaselin Toplaov: each player used a computer as a partner. This cyborg play style, sometimes called "centaur chess", created better players than individual humans or machines.

### Design and Construction of Art Toys

Each art toy has three kinds of elements:

- Inputs: Can be anything from simple keyboards input or scrool wheels, tablet pens, full body tracking.
- Transformation: An art toy takes that input can either render it directly or transform it to different kinds of data.
- Rendering: Visual result of the interaction.

### Outside the Generator: Judgment, Sharing, and Curation

Often most powerful interactions happen outside the generator.

### Conclusion

Procedural content make art toys more powerful, surprising, generative, and welcoming to new users.
