# Procedural Generation In Game Design

## Chapter 16 Generative Art Toys

Everyone likes being creative.

Art toys are more free, they are not bounded to game context. If we focus on the content more player can directly interact with the generator itself. When users feel creative' both the users and apps win.

Become a Great Artist in Just 10 Seconds by Michael Brough and Andi McClure is a good example of art toy.

### Trading Control for Power

The central idea behind an art toy is that user is trading away control and gaining power. Art tools and art toys are different in this sense.

The automation has taken away a bit of freedom, but has given us a faster more reliable way to get to satisfying results.
