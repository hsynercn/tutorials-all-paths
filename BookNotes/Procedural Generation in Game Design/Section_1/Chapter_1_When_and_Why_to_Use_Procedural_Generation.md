# Procedural Generation In Game Design

## Chapter 1 When and Why to Use Procedural Generation

Procedural Generation Techniques(PCG) are now used widely through game design and development. Content drafting to on-the-fly generation, graphical effects to responsive narrative.

Planning when to use procedural generation

- Integral: Some games deliver the core game play with PCG.
- Drafting Content: PCG is often used in game development to produce a large amount of content that is then polished later. One example is Skyrim.
- Modal: Some games use PCG to create a 'infinity mode', a special piece of side content to the main one.
- Segmented: Certain segments of a game can be squared off from the rest of the design to use PCG.

When PCG is a bad idea, it could be a black hole

- Quality assurance: PCG game may not work as intended 100% of the time. There is no way of having testers go through every single iteration. Some prefer creating building blocks with PCG and use them for real content.
- Time restrictions:A handcrafted process takes a more predictable amount of time. PCG could take some time.
- Authored Experience: In most cases designer wishes to create a linear experience. These type of games benefit less from PCG.
- Multiplayer: Control of game balance in PCG isn't always easy. Generator can cause imbalanced outputs.
- Just Random: If you don't have resource to make interesting procedural content, then typically you end up with something just random. We can consider using PCG in that case.
- Over reliance on PCG: We should keep our focus on core game play. PCG cannot carry a game.

 Why Use Procedural Generation?

 Mostly we say the level-headed reasons but in the back we are dreaming of playing with infinity.

- Utilitarian
  - Time-saving: We can create huge amounts of content far faster than a manual process. There are two man processes, procedural gen followed by polish, or manual world gen followed by using procedural tools to generate varied content. Note that we can spend more time with debugging the PCG.
  - Expandable: Generators are usually designed modularity. Every new feature is integrated across the generator's output
  - Re-Playability: One generator can make similar but varied content. Rogue like get benefits from this.
  - Reusable code: Generators can get reused between applications.
  - Rules enforcement: We can enforce rules to ensure connectivity between elements or certain standards maintained across all output.
  - Modeling reality: We use simulations techniques in PCG.
  - Scales and detail hard to do by hand: Small teams can't create large scale content and details.
  - Overcome technical limitations: Early games leveraged PCG approach to overcome hardware limitations. This is not applied to modern conditions.
- Unique
  - Individual experiences: PCG provides potential to give every user a unique experience.
  - New game play/interaction modes & player input: PCG could be a game play element.
  - Unpredictable: For QA perspective it could be scary also it could be thrilling.
  - Living system: Procedural techniques can produce living mechanics.
  - Inhuman creativity: The outputs of PCG can be bizarre.
  - Reflections and refraction of humanity: We can use user specific aspects to feed the generator, we can get the reflection of the user.
  - Inspiration of infinity: This is fun.
  - Fun: Also playing with procedural generation is quite fun.
