# Procedural Generation In Game Design

## Chapter 3 Aesthetics in Procedural Generation

The key to creating satisfying aesthetics is the creation of a collection of guides and rules that enable you to maintain a coherent look and feel across an entire project. This requires the development of a language that you will use to communicate the themes, sense of place, and story of your game to the player.

In his respect, we can imagine procedural generation engine as a member of your team that works alongside.

Case Sunless Sea: In this case designers created a random world for each game start. Every discovery should feel exciting and fresh, it should also feel natural.

Establishing the Rules: When we create a grid-and-tile-based approach we could fine-tune the rules to create a more natural look. For example, we can adjust the tile size and transition between regions.

Also blurring the boundaries between regions can help to create a more natural look. We can create soft transitions between regions, music change, weather change, and so on.

Tile-based procedural generation could provide the fresh challenge for user, also we can keep that under control. One problematic idea could be hand crafting the tiles to increase the variety of the results. This could be time-consuming and hard to debug.
