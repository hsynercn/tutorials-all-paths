# Procedural Generation In Game Design

## Chapter 19 Emergent Narratives and Story Volumes

Procedural content will provide unique experiences to individual users. Also they enable player narratives.

### The Voice In the Machine

Scripted narrative lies in the author's use of literary elements like theme, tone, voice, and mood.

In procedural design it is possible to insert elements like themes and mood into both rules of generative systems and the handcrafted atoms that procedurally combines.

Fiasco is a example of a game that uses procedural generation to create a narrative. It is a tabletop role-playing game that uses a set of rules to create a story. Players are given a set of characters and a set of relationships between them. They are also given a set of objects that will be used in the story. The game is played in turns. In each turn a player will choose to either establish a scene or resolve a scene. If the player chooses to establish a scene, he will choose a character, a relationship, and an object. Then he will set the scene and play it out. If the player chooses to resolve a scene, he will choose a character, a relationship, and an object. Then the other players will set the scene and play it out. After the scene is played out, the player will roll a set of dice. The dice will determine if the scene ends well or badly for the character. The game is played until all the dice are used. The game is designed to create a story that is similar to a Coen Brothers movie.

### Grist for the Narrative Mill

Emergent narratives emerge more discernibly from the interaction of the player with the game world. Stories needs characters, and Ugo's name position him as a character. With enough content player interactions with Ugo take on new meaning.
