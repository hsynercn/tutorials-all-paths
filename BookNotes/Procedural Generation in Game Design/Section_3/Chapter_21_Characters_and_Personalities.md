# Procedural Generation In Game Design

## Chapter 21 Characters and Personalities

For procedurally generated characters:

- Description: A system that procedurally creates descriptions of characters or personalities.
- Realization: Nonplayer character (NPCs) dialogues and actions.
- Creation: A system that procedurally assembles NPC character profiles.

### Source Material

We will be mentioning several examples from When in Rome 2 and Versu game platforms.

### Realization

For most projects, procedural realization has meant choosing what to say, and then how to say it.

- Selecting dialogue: Versu modeled characters have their own unique dialogue around certain topics and ideas. Versu's conversation rules controls transition form one topic to another, encouraging characters to talk about things that are relevant to the current situation.

- Layering Dialogue Features: We can use a grammar like structure to create dialogue. [gesture][consent] -> The robot crosses her legs. "If you wishest it,yea!"

- Character and World Interaction: Versu threads world model like a stage

### Creation

Dynamic character creation introduces further constraints, especially if we intend the player to interact with a character in different ways depending on character's strengths.

In this case designing our vocabulary becomes  a subset of game design.

- Orthogonal: Traits should be orthogonal, they will apply to different aspects of character's life.
- Mechanically Significant: If a game is heavy in story or meant to be played only once, the fiction probably carries quite a bit of weight with the player, coloring her experience of the entire game. If we could add more fictional layers it will be better.
- Easy to Communicate: Complicated traits will be hard to communicate to the player.
- Meaningful in Combination: Making your elements mechanically significant and creating meaningful combinations of them will make your characters more interesting.

### Recurring Strategies

- Combining output form several layers of simulation or gameplay.
- Bringing character into every interaction.
- Juxtaposing event and interpretation.
- Callbacks to earlier events.

### Pitfalls

- Overgeneralization
- Overrealism
- Untamed simulation
