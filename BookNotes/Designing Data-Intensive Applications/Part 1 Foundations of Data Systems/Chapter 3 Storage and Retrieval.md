# Chapter 3. Storage and Retrieval

A database do 2 things:

- store data 
- provide data when requested

This chapter will explain the mechanics of database internally.

We need to know internals of Q database to use it optionally, at least as a rough idea.



There are 2 main groups of storage engines:

- optimized for transactional workloods
- optimezed for analytics


For this chapter we will mainly focus on relational and nosql databases, we will examine 2 families of storage engines:

- log structured
- page oriented
