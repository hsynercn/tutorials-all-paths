# Cracking the Coding Interview

## Foreword

Interview process requires special skills that you can learn and practice, and this book is designed to teach you those skills. They are not taught in school, and they are not taught in work. They are not about programming, but about how to solve problems.

### I Interview Process

Algorithm and coding problems form the largest component of the interview process at most of tech companies.

Interviewer will make an assessment with:

- Analytical skills: How did you get the solution?
- Coding skills: Can you translate your solution into code?
- Technical knowledge / Computer Science fundamentals: Do you have strong foundation?
- Experience: Have you build interesting, challenging things projects?
- Culture fit / Communication skills: Are you someone they want to work with?

False negatives are acceptable

- Companies don't care about false negatives, they accept their loss of good candidates. They are more concerned about false positives, because they don't want to hire someone who can't do the job.

Problem solving skills are valuable.

- If you can solve hard problems that means you are good at developing optimal algorithms.

Basic data structures and algorithm knowledge is useful.

- Learning CS scope is helpful for problem solving. Tress, graphs, linked lists will be helpful.

Whiteboard lets you focus on what matters.

- Main goal is not writing the perfect code on the board, but we need to write some code with minimal errors.

Whiteboard interviews not for everyone and every company.

### II Behind the Scenes

Mostly companies follow similar interview processes.

- Microsoft
- Google
- Apple
- Facebook
- Palantir

Usually there are 5-6 interviews, each 45-60 minutes long. They start with a phone screen, then 4-5 on-site interviews.

- Microsoft Interview: Microsoft wants smart people.
- Amazon Interview: Several people will check different aspects of your skills. Focus areas are scalability and object oriented design.
- Google Interview: Focus areas are scalability and analytical algorithm skills.
- Apple Interview: Focus on the product.
- Facebook Interview: Facebook wants passionate people. Show them you like to build stuff.

### III Special Situations

Experienced Candidates

Be prepared for algorithm and system design questions. In every case you will be asked.

Testers and SDETs

Be prepared for algorithm and coding questions.

Product and Program Managers

- Handle ambiguity
- Customer focus > attitude, how user will use the product
- Customer focus > technical skills
- Multi-level communication
- Passion for technology
- Teamwork, leadership
