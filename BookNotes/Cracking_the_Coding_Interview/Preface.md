# Cracking the Coding Interview

## Foreword

Interview process requires special skills that you can learn and practice, and this book is designed to teach you those skills. They are not taught in school, and they are not taught in work. They are not about programming, but about how to solve problems.

### Interview Process

Algorithm and coding problems form the largest component of the interview process at most of tech companies.

Interviewer will make an assessment with:

- Analytical skills: How did you get the solution?
- Coding skills: Can you translate your solution into code?
- Technical knowledge / Computer Science fundamentals: Do you have strong foundation?
- Experience: Have you build interesting, challenging things projects?
- Culture fit / Communication skills: Are you someone they want to work with?

False negatives are acceptable

- Companies don't care about false negatives, they accept their loss of good candidates. They are more concerned about false positives, because they don't want to hire someone who can't do the job.

Problem solving skills are valuable.

- If you can solve hard problems that means you are good at developing optimal algorithms.

Basic data structures and algorithm knowledge is useful.
