# Longest Peak

Write a function that takes in an array of integers and returns the length of the longest peak in the array.

A peak is defined as adjacent integers in the array that are strictly increasing until they reach a tip (the highest value in the peak), at which point they become strictly decreasing. At least three integers are required to form a peak.

For example, the integers `1, 4, 10, 2` form a peak, but the integers `4, 0, 10` don't and neither do the integers `1, 2, 2, 0`. Similarly, the integers `1, 2, 3` don't form a peak because there aren't any strictly decreasing integers after the `3`.

Sample Input
```
array = [1, 2, 3, 3, 4, 0, 10, 6, 5, -1, -3, 2, 3]
```

Sample Output
```
6 // 0, 10, 6, 5, -1, -3
```

Hints

Hint 1

You can solve this question by iterating through the array from left to right once.

Hint 2

Iterate through the array from left to right, and treat every integer as the potential tip of a peak. To be the tip of a peak, an integer has to be strictly greater than its adjacent integers. What can you do when you find an actual tip?

Hint 3

As you iterate through the array from left to right, whenever you find a tip of a peak, expand outwards from the tip until you no longer have a peak. Given what peaks look like and how many peaks can therefore fit in an array, realize that this process results in a linear-time algorithm. Make sure to keep track of the longest peak you find as you iterate through the array.
