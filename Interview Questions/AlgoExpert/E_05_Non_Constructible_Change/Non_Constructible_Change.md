# Non-Constructible Change

Given an array of positive integers representing the values of coins in your
possession, write a function that returns the minimum amount of change (the
minimum sum of money) that you cannot create. The given coins can have
any positive integer value and aren't necessarily unique (i.e., you can have
multiple coins of the same value).

For example, if you're given `coins = [1, 2, 5]`, the minimum amount of change that you can't create is `4`. If you're given no coins, the minimum amount of change that you can't create is `1`.

Sample Input

```
coins = [5, 7, 1, 1, 2, 3, 22]
```

Sample Output

```
20
```

Hints

Hint 1

One approach to solve this problem is to attempt to create every single amount
of change, starting at 1 and going up until you eventually can't create an
amount. While this approach works, there is a better one.

Hint 2

Start by sorting the input array. Since you're trying to find the minimum amount of change that you can't create, it makes sense to consider the smallest coins first.

Hint 3

To understand the optimal approach to this problem, consider the following example: `coins = [1, 2, 4]`. Using only the coins in this array, you can create `1`, `2`, `3`, `4`, `5`, `6`, `7` cents worth of change. Now, if you were to add a coin of value `9` to this set, we would be able to create 8 cents. However, if you were to add a coin of value `7`, we would only be able to create 8 cents, and we would also be able to create all values of change from `1` to `15`. Why is this the case?

Hint 4

Create a variable to store the amount of change that you can currently create
up to. Sort all of your coins, and loop through them in ascending order. At
every iteration, compare the current coin to the amount of change that you can
currently create up to. Here are the two scenarios that you'll encounter:

- The coin value is greater than the amount of change that you can currently create plus 1.
- The coin value is smaller or equal to the amount of change that you can currently create plus 1.

  In the first scenario, you simply return the current amount of change that you
  can create plus 1, because you can't create that amount of change. In the
  second scenario, you add the value of the coin to the amount of change that
  you can currently create up to, and you continue iterating through the coins.

The reason for this is that, if you're in the second scenario, you can create all the values of change that you can currently create plus the value of the coin that you just considered. If you're given coins `[1, 2]`, then you can make `1, 2, 3` cents. So if you add a coin value `4`, then you can make `4 + 1` cents, `4 + 2` cents, and `4 + 3` cents. Thus, you can make up to `7` cents.
