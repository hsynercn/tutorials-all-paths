# Palindrome Check

write a function that takes in a non-empty string and that returns a boolean representing whether the string is a palindrome.

A palindrome is defined as a string that's written the same forward and backward. Note that single-character strings are palindromes.

Sample Input
```
string = "abcdcba"
```

Sample Output
```
true // it's written the same forward and backward
```

Hints

Hint 1

Start by building the input string in reverse order and comparing this newly built string to the input string. Can you do this without using string concatenations?

Hint 2

Can you optimize your algorithm by using recursion? What are the implications of recursion on an algorithm's space-time complexity analysis?

Hint 3

Go back to an iterative solution and try using pointers to solve this problem: start with a pointer at the first index of the string and a pointer at the final index of the string. What can you do from there?

Optimal Space & Time Complexity

O(n) time | O(1) space - where n is the length of the input string
