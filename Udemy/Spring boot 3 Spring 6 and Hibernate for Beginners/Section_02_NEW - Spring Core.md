### 33. What is Inversion of Control

Inversion of Control: The approach of outsourcing the construction and management of objects.

Spring Container

The Spring container is responsible for instantiating, configuring and assembling objects.

For example my app will request a "Coach" object and the Spring container will provide the "Coach".

Spring Container Primary Functions:

- Create and manage objects (Inversion of Control)
- Inject object dependencies (Dependency Injection)

Configuring Spring Container

- XML configuration file (legacy) we will not use this
- Java Annotations (modern)
- Java Source Code (modern)

### 34. Defining Dependency Injection - Overview - Part 1

Dependency Injection

The dependency inversion principle. The client delegates the another the responsibility of providing its dependencies.

Spring Container

Give me a assembled "Coach" object with all dependencies injected.

Some helper objects (dependencies):

- Give me a "Coach" object
  - CricketCoach
  - HockeyCoach
  - BaseballCoach

Injection Types: There are multiple types of injection with Spring

- Constructor Injection
  - Use this when you have required dependencies
  - Generally recommended by the Spring team
- Setter Injection
  - Use this when you have optional dependencies
  - If dependency is not provided, your app can provide reasonable default logic

What is Spring AutoWiring?

Spring will look for a class that matches , matches by class of interface. Spring will inject it automatically.

AutoWiring Example

- Inject a Coach implementation
- Spring will scan for @Components
- Any Ä±ne implements the Coach interface?
- If so, let's inject it, for example: CricketCoach

```

Development Process

1. Define the dependency interface and class
2. Create a Demo rest Controller
3. Create a constructor in your class for injections
4. Add @GetMapping method to expose the endpoint

Step 1: Define the dependency interface and class

Coach.java
```java
package com.luv2code.springcoredemo;

public interface Coach {
    public String getDailyWorkout();
}
```

CrickeCoach.java
```java
package com.luv2code.springcoredemo;

import org.springframework.stereotype.Component;

@Component
public class CricketCoach implements Coach {
    @Override
    public String getDailyWorkout() {
        return "Practice fast bowling for 15 minutes";
    }
}
```

@Componenet annotation:

- Marks the class as a Spring Bean.
- makes the bean available for dependency injection.

DemoController.java
```java
package com.luv2code.springcoredemo;

import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Autowired;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.GetMapping;

@RestContoller
public class DemoController {
    private Coach myCoach;

    @Autowired
    public DemoController(Coach theCoach) {
        myCoach = theCoach;
    }

    @GetMapping("/dailyworkout")
    public String getDailyWorkout() {
        return myCoach.getDailyWorkout();
    }
}
```

If you have only one constructor, @Autowired is optional.
