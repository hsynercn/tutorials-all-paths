### 33. What is Inversion of Control

Inversion of Control: The approach of outsourcing the construction and management of objects.

Spring Container

The Spring container is responsible for instantiating, configuring and assembling objects.

For example my app will request a "Coach" object and the Spring container will provide the "Coach".

Spring Container Primary Functions:

- Create and manage objects (Inversion of Control)
- Inject object dependencies (Dependency Injection)

Configuring Spring Container

- XML configuration file (legacy) we will not use this
- Java Annotations (modern)
- Java Source Code (modern)
