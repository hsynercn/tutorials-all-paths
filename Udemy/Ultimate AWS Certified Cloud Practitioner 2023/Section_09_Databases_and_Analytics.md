## Section 09 - Databases and Analytics

### Database Introduction

- Storing data on disk can have its limitations
  - EFS (Elastic File System)
  - EBS (Elastic Block Store)
  - EC2 Instance Store
  - S3
- In some cases we need to store data in a database
- We can structure the data
- We can build indexes to efficiently query/search the data
- We can define relationships between datasets

Databases are optimized for a purpose and come with different features, shapes and constraints.

Relational Databases

- looks like excel spreadsheets
- We use relations between tables
- Can use the SQL language to perform queries / lookups

NoSQL Databases

- NoSQL = non relational
- NoSQL databases are purpose built for specific data models and have flexible schemas for building modern applications
- Benefits:
  - Flexibility: easy to evolve data model
  - Scalability: designed to scale out by using distributed clusters
  - High performance: optimized for a specific data model and use case
  - Highly functional: built-in functions to perform complex queries

Examples: Key-value, document, graph, in-memory, search databases
