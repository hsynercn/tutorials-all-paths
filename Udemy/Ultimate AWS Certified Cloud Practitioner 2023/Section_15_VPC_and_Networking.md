# Ultimate AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner 2023

## Section 15 VPC and Networking

### VPC Overview

- VPC is something you should know in depth for the AWS Certified Cloud Solutions Architect Associate and AWS Certified SysOps Administrator.

- At the AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner Level, you should know about:
  - VPC (Virtual Private Cloud), Internet Gateways and NAT Gateways (Network Address Translation)
  - Security Groups and Network ACL (Access Control Lists), VPC Flow Logs
  - VPC Peering, VPC Endpoints
  - Site to Site VPN and Direct Connect
  - Transit Gateway

- I will just give you an overview, less than 1 or 2 questions at your exam.
- We will look at the "default VPC" (created by default by AWS for you)
- There is a summary lecture at the end. It's ok if you don't understand everything right now.
