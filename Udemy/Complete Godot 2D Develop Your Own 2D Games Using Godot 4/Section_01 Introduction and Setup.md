# Complete Godot 2D Develop Your Own 2D Games Using Godot 4

## Section 01 Introduction and Setup

### 1. Welcome to the Course

We will download and explore the Godot Engine.

### 2. Downloading Godot

Download the Godot Engine from the official website.

[Godot Engine](https://godotengine.org/)

### 3. Creating a New Project

For mac environment it is better to copy the Godot Engine to the Applications folder. Separating the different version could be useful.

Mono version requires .net framework to be installed.

### 4. Exploring the Godot Interface

Viewport is the camera. It is the window that shows the game. This course will focus on 2D games.

Nodes and Scenes

- Nodes are the building blocks of Godot
- A scene is a bunch of nodes grouped together
- There are different types of nodes with different functionalities
- A Godot game is made out of many scenes

After we add the first 2D scene we will get the parent node called "Node2D". We can rename it.

Inspector window shows the properties of the selected node.

We can add a 2D sprite node under the main node. If we check the inspector we will see the texture property. We can add a texture to the sprite, there is a default icon in the Godot Engine. We can drag and drop the texture to the texture property.

### 5. More Interface Exploration

Blue rectangle is the main viewport.

We can change the viewport setting from the project settings.

Tool tab:

- Select mode is used to select the nodes in the scene.
- Move mode is used to move the nodes in the scene.
- Rotate mode is used to rotate the nodes in the scene.
- Scale mode is used to scale the nodes in the scene.

We can use the keyboard shortcuts to change the modes.

### 6. Community and Resources

GameDev community is very active. We can find many resources on the internet.

Discord is a good place to ask questions.
