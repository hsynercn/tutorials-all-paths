# Complete Godot 2D Develop Your Own 2D Games Using Godot 4

## Section 02 Speedy Saucer

### 8. Section Intro - Speedy Saucer

We will create a simple game called Speedy Saucer. We will try to keep saucer in the screen and avoid the obstacles.

### Project Setup

We will create an empty 2D scene.

We will get the assets from the kenney.nl website.

We will install the Space Shooter Redux asset from this [link](https://kenney.nl/assets/space-shooter-redux).

We will use:

- darkPurple.png
- purple.png
- ufoGreen.png

We will create a new TextureRect node we will add the darkPurple.png texture to it. We will set the stretch mode to tile to make the texture repeat itself. By this way resolution will not be a problem.
